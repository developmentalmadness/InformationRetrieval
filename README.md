This project is a means to teach myself [information retrieval (IR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval) techniques. While this is an entirely personal endeavor I will attempt to make the contents of the project easy to grok by providing lots of comments and making the code as readable as possible.

So far these are the examples in this project:

* Inverted Index - a search engine used to index documents for searching which ranks the results using [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) to determine relevancy.
* [Bloom Filter (in progress)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) - a probabalistic data structure used to test for membership in a set. [see also](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/09/counting-bloom-filters.html).
